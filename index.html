            <h2>Amaro Terrazas</h2>
                <p>Hello there, I am a student in Austin Code Academy. It is where I am learning about software engineering and I am learning every single day. I am not your typical web developer, then again what is a typical web developer?
                    Anyways, here is my portfolio, this has been created with what I have learned so far from school within a matter a few weeks. I love seeing my own work, I am my own critic and I strive to get better everyday!
